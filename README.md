# 🏠 K8s Home Cluster

Welcome to my Kubernetes home lab! This repository contains the configuration and manifests for my personal Kubernetes cluster running at home. 

## 🎯 Project Goal

The ultimate goal of this project is to migrate 100% of my home infrastructure to Kubernetes. This is an ongoing journey where I'm learning, experimenting, and building a fully self-hosted environment.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This repository contains:
- Kubernetes manifests and configurations
- Infrastructure as Code setup

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Kubernetes** - The orchestration platform
- **Talos** - For managing Kubernetes cluster / nodes

## 📚 Learning Journey

This is a living project where I'm constantly:
- Adding new services
- Improving configurations
- Learning best practices
- Breaking things and fixing them 😅
